# Firebase Test

## What I have done?
- On Firebase Created New Project
- Then Also Tick mark the Google Analytics
- Last Created. It will done after 30-45 seconds.
- Now I created the folder on local system
- After that created two files index.html and index.js
- In index.html fetching Real time data from the firebase through my index.js
- index.js file code copy from firebase
    ### Steps
    - On Project Overview click on "</>"
    - then click script
    - now you can copy and paste script to index.js
- Now on Firebase, Select RealTime Database and create realtime data.
- Then in your js file fetch that data.
- However you can get idea about how to fetch data from the firebase in my index.js.
- I already did the comment, // Databae. SO below this there is the database connection and fetching data from the firebase.
